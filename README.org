** Lecture Information

- The goal of this lecture is to introduce you to the tools you need to learn
  to tackle more advanced engineering problems.
- These could be ranging from doing circuit analysis to calculating the stress
  experienced by a bridge which will be covered in this lecture series as
  examples.
     
The structure for this lecture is as follows.
