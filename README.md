# Content Home

All lecture content sans the assignment(s) and important announcmenets
will be hosted on the lectures Github Page which you can find it

# A Gentle Introduction

Welcome to the lecture materials for use in **M.Sc - Higher Mathematics
I** where our focus will be on the topics of:

1.  An overview on the types of ordinary differential equations and how
    to solve them.
2.  A significant refreshment on the topic of linear algebra and its
    applications in engineering.
3.  A look into defining what vector calculus is, its theorems and
    applications

**NOTE:** As the lecture is splitted into the tutorial and lectures, for
the sake of smooth continuation it is decided to make the lectures in
one continuous stream irregardless of whether it is a tutorial or
teaching session.

## Lecture Information

The details of the lecture are given below.

### Assignments

There will be one (**1**) assignments for this course.

The grade breakdown is as follows:

| DEFINITION        | GRADE (%) |
|-------------------|-----------|
| Final Examination | 100       |
| Sum               | 100       |

**NOTE:** For the exam you will be allowed a calculator without any
computational means (i.e., no TI-84, Hp 50g, …). You are also not
allowed a personal cheat sheet as all important equations and
information will be given to you with the exam.

## The Lecture Structure

As it currently is, the lecture covers topic from ordinary differential
equations, linear algebra and vector calculis. The structure of the
lecture is shown below.

| ORDER | TOPIC | DESCRIPTION |
|----|----|----|
| 1 | Introduction | Discussion of the lecture structure and what will be covered |
| 2 | First-Order ODEs | Separable ODEs, Exact ODEs, Linear ODEs |
| 3 | Second-Order Linear ODEs | Homogeneous Linear ODEs, Euler-Cauchy Equations |
| 4 | Higher-Order Linear ODEs | Homogeneous and non-homogeneous Linear ODEs |
| 5 | Systems of ODEs. Phase Plane. Qualitative Methods | Constant-Coefficient Systems, Phase Plane Method |
| 6 | Series Solutions of ODEs & Special Functions | Legendre’s Equation, Legendre Polynomials |
| 7 | Laplace Transforms | Laplace Transform, Linearity, First Shifting Theorem |
| 8 | Linear Algebra I: Matrices and Vectors | Linear Systems of Equations, Gauss Elimination |
| 9 | Linear Algebra II: Eigenvalue Problems | Determining Eigenvalues and Eigenvectors |
| 10 | Vector Calculus I: Grad, Div, Curl | Vector and Scalar Functions and Their Fields |
| 11 | Vector Calculus II: Integral Theorems | Path Independence of Line Integrals |

## Code Supplement

The Code supplement is a Github webpage dedicated to hosting all the
relevant code used in the lecture as it is not feasible to fit all the
content of the code to the slides and it is easier to share this way.
